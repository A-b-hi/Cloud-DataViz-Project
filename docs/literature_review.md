Data visualization is an essential technique for converting raw data into meaningful insights through graphical representations such as charts and dashboards. Modern organizations rely on visualization tools to support data-driven decision making.

Virtualization technology allows multiple operating systems and applications to run independently on shared hardware. By using virtual machines, systems gain portability, isolation, and efficient resource utilization.

Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet. It enables scalability, high availability, and remote accessibility. The integration of data visualization with virtualization and cloud computing allows dashboards to be deployed centrally and accessed securely from any location, making it suitable for real-world analytical systems.
