The proposed system follows a layered architecture consisting of data, visualization, virtualization, and cloud access layers. The dataset is processed using a data visualization tool to generate interactive dashboards. These dashboards are hosted within a virtual machine environment, ensuring isolation and portability. Cloud services enable remote access to the dashboards through internet connectivity. This architecture allows centralized deployment, scalability, and platform independence while maintaining system reliability.
