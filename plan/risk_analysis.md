### Identified Risks

#### 1. Dataset Quality Risk
The dataset used for visualization may contain missing values, incorrect entries, or inconsistencies that can affect visualization accuracy.

**Impact:**  
Incorrect insights and misleading dashboards.

**Mitigation Strategy:**  
- Validate dataset before use  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Maintain backup datasets  

---

#### 2. Visualization Complexity Risk
Improper selection of visualization techniques may lead to poor interpretation of data.

**Impact:**  
Reduced clarity and effectiveness of dashboards.

**Mitigation Strategy:**  
- Use appropriate chart types for each data attribute  
- Follow data visualization best practices  
- Test dashboards with sample users  

---

#### 3. Virtual Machine Configuration Risk
Errors in virtual machine setup may cause deployment delays or system instability.

**Impact:**  
Delayed project progress and deployment issues.

**Mitigation Strategy:**  
- Use stable virtualization platforms  
- Maintain VM snapshots  
- Document VM configuration steps  

---

#### 4. Cloud Accessibility Risk
Internet connectivity or cloud service availability issues may affect remote access to dashboards.

**Impact:**  
Temporary unavailability of system.

**Mitigation Strategy:**  
- Ensure offline development capability  
- Test cloud access on multiple networks  
- Use reliable cloud platforms  

---

#### 5. Time Management Risk
Delays in completing tasks within the planned timeline may affect final submission.

**Impact:**  
Incomplete project or rushed implementation.

**Mitigation Strategy:**  
- Follow weekly milestones strictly  
- Maintain regular GitHub commits  
- Allocate buffer time for critical tasks  

---

### Risk Monitoring Strategy
- Regular weekly progress review  
- Continuous testing after each phase  
- Version control using GitHub to track changes  

---

This risk analysis ensures that potential challenges are anticipated and handled effectively, improving project reliability and successful completion.
